# LaserStramash Launcher
Weapons-grade Free Software laser tag system.

The launcher is gathers up the necessary information to start a game, and then 
emits the MQTT messages necessary to get the game started.

In the prototype, it is the simplest of interactive command-line applications.
Eventually, this will be replaced with something neater - a PyQT app, or
a web interface or something.
